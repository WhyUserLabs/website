            <strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 14, 2025
        </p>

        <p>
            This Beta User Agreement ("<strong>Agreement</strong>") is a binding legal agreement 
            between you (the "<strong>Customer</strong>" or "<strong>You</strong>") and 
            <strong>WhyUser, Inc.</strong> ("<strong>WhyUser</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," 
            "<strong>us</strong>," or "<strong>our</strong>").
        </p>
        <p>
            By clicking "I Agree" or by accessing or using the Service (defined below), 
            you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you are entering into this 
            Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent 
            that you have the authority to bind such entity to this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
            This Agreement governs your access to and use of our beta-stage B2B 
            go-to-market simulation platform (the "<strong>Service</strong>"). This 
            Agreement is separate from our public 
            <a href="/legal/terms-of-use">Website Terms of Use</a>, which only 
            governs our public-facing website.
        </p>

        <h2>1.0 The Service & Beta Access</h2>
        <p>
            WhyUser grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable 
            license to access and use the Service for the sole purpose of internal 
            business evaluation and to provide feedback to WhyUser (the "<strong>Purpose</strong>").
        </p>
        <p>
            You acknowledge that the Service is a beta version and is provided 
            on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. The Service may contain bugs, 
            errors, and other defects. WhyUser is under no obligation to provide 
            any technical support, or to correct any bugs or errors.
        </p>

        <h2>2.0 Your Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>You agree that you will not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to discover the

            <li>Use the Service for any purpose other than the limited Purpose 
                described herein.</li>
            <li>Share your access credentials or permit any third party to access 
                the Service.</li>
            <li>Use the Service to store or transmit any material in violation of 
                third-party privacy or intellectual property rights.</li>
            <li>Use the Service to build a competitive product or service.</li>
        </ul>

            interest in and to all data, information, sales call transcripts, 
            CRM data, or other materials you upload to or provide to the 
            Service ("<strong>Customer Data</strong>").

            You grant WhyUser a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide 
            license to use, copy, store, transmit, and display your Customer Data 
            <strong>solely to the extent necessary to provide, maintain, and 
            improve the Service</strong> and to monitor and improve the 
            Service's performance. We will not use your Customer Data for any 
            other purpose without your express consent.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 Your Responsibility for Customer Data</h3>
        <p>
            You represent and warrant that you have obtained all necessary rights, 
            consents, and permissions to provide your Customer Data to WhyUser 
            and to grant the license in Section 3.2. You are solely responsible 
            for the accuracy, legality, and content of your Customer Data.
        </p>

        <h2>4.0 Confidentiality</h2>

        <h3>4.1 WhyUser's Confidential Information</h3>
        <p>
            You acknowledge that the Service (including its "look and feel," 
            features, and functionality) and any simulation reports, playbooks, 
            or analyses generated by the Service (collectively, "<strong>Reports</strong>") 
            are the confidential and proprietary information of WhyUser 
            ("<strong>WhyUser Confidential Information</strong>"). You agree to hold 
            WhyUser Confidential Information in strict confidence and not to 
            disclose it to any third party or use it for any purpose other 
            than the Purpose of this Agreement.
        </p>

        <h3>4.2 Customer's Confidential Information</h3>
        <p>
            WhyUser agrees that your Customer Data (such as your sales transcripts) 
            is your confidential information ("<strong>Customer Confidential 
            Information</strong>"). WhyUser will use the same degree of care that 
            it uses to protect its own confidential information (but not less 
            than reasonable care) to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure 
            of your Customer Data.
        </p>
        
        <h3>4.3 Exceptions</h3>
        <p>
            Confidential Information does not include information that (i) is 
            or becomes publicly known through no fault of the receiving party; 
            (ii) was rightfully known by the receiving party prior to disclosure; 
            or (iii) is independently developed by the receiving party without 
            use of the disclosing party's Confidential Information.
        </p>

        <h2>5.0 Feedback</h2>
        <p>
            In consideration for access to the Service, you agree to provide 
            WhyUser with feedback, suggestions, and reports on the performance 
            and usability of the Service ("<strong>Feedback</strong>").
        </p>
        <p>
            You hereby grant WhyUser a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, 
            royalty-free, fully paid-up license to use, modify, and incorporate 
            such Feedback into its products and services without any obligation
