            </p>

            <p>
                This Beta User Agreement ("<strong>Agreement</strong>") is a binding legal agreement 
                between you (the "<strong>Customer</strong>" or "<strong>You</strong>") and 
                <strong>WhyUser, Inc.</strong> ("<strong>WhyUser</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," 
                "<strong>us</strong>," or "<strong>our</strong>").
            </p>
            <p>
                By clicking "I Agree" or by accessing or using the Service (defined below), 
                you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you are entering into this 
                Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent 
                that you have the authority to bind such entity to this Agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Agreement governs your access to and use of our beta-stage B2B 
                go-to-market simulation platform (the "<strong>Service</strong>"). This 
                Agreement is separate from our public 
                <a href="/legal/website-terms-of-use.html">Website Terms of Use</a>, which only 
                governs our public-facing website.
            </p>

            <h2>1.0 The Service & Beta Access</h2>
            <p>
                WhyUser grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable 
                license to access and use the Service for the sole purpose of internal 
                business evaluation and to provide feedback to WhyUser (the "<strong>Purpose</strong>").
            </p>
            <p>
                You acknowledge that the Service is a beta version and is provided 
                on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. The Service may contain bugs, 
                errors, and other defects. WhyUser is under no obligation to provide 
                any technical support, or to correct any bugs or errors.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to discover the 
                    source code or underlying ideas or algorithms of the Service.</li>
                <li>Use the Service for any purpose other than the limited Purpose 
                    described herein.</li>

            <h3>3.1 Your Ownership of Customer Data</h3>
            <p>
                As between you and WhyUser, you retain all right, title, and 
                interest in and to all data, information, sales call transcripts, 
                CRM data, or other materials you upload to or provide to the 
                Service ("<strong>Customer Data</strong>").
            </p>

            <h3>3.2 Our Limited License to Your Data</h3>
            <p>
                You grant WhyUser a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide 
                license to use, copy, store, transmit, and display your Customer Data 
                <strong>solely to the extent necessary to provide, maintain, and 
                improve the Service</strong> and to monitor and improve the 
                Service's performance. We will not use your Customer Data for any 
                other purpose without your express consent.
            </p>

            <h3>3.3 Your Responsibility for Customer Data</h3>
            <p>
                You represent and warrant that you have obtained all necessary rights, 
                consents, and permissions to provide your Customer Data to WhyUser 
                and to grant the license in Section 3.2. You are solely responsible 
                for the accuracy, legality, and content of your Customer Data.
            </p>

            <h2>4.0 Confidentiality</h2>

            <h3>4.1 WhyUser's Confidential Information</h3>
            <p>
                You acknowledge that the Service (including its "look and feel," 
                features, and functionality) and any simulation reports, playbooks, 
                or analyses generated by the Service (collectively, "<strong>Reports</strong>") 
                are the confidential and proprietary information of WhyUser 
                ("<strong>WhyUser Confidential Information</strong>"). You agree to hold 
                WhyUser Confidential Information in strict confidence and not to 
                disclose it to any third party or use it for any purpose other 
                than the Purpose of this Agreement.
            </p>

            <h3>4.2 Customer's Confidential Information</h3>
            <p>
                WhyUser agrees that your Customer Data (such as your sales transcripts) 
                is your confidential information ("<strong>Customer Confidential 
                Information</strong>"). WhyUser will use the same degree of care that 
                it uses to protect its own confidential information (but not less 
                than reasonable care) to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure 
                of your Customer Data.
            </p>
            
            <h3>4.3 Exceptions</h3>
            <p>
                Confidential Information does not include information that (i) is 
                or becomes publicly known through no fault of the receiving party; 
                (ii) was rightfully known by the receiving party prior to disclosure; 
                or (iii) is independently developed by the receiving party without 
                use of the disclosing party's Confidential Information.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                You hereby grant WhyUser a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, 
                royalty-free, fully paid-up license to use, modify, and incorporate 
                such Feedback into its products and services without any obligation
