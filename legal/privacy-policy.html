        </p>

        <p>
            Welcome to WhyUser. This Privacy Policy explains how

            collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you visit our website 
            (www.whyuser.com) and any other websites, social media pages, or forms that link to this 
            Privacy Policy (collectively, the "<strong>Sites</strong>").

            agreement between us and our Customer. If you are an individual whose data has 
            been submitted to our Service by a WhyUser Customer (such as an employee or 
            customer of that Customer), you should contact that Customer directly with 
            any privacy-related questions.
        </p>
